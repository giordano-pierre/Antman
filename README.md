# Antman

Antman is a project that focuses on data compression. The goal of this project is to provide a set of programs that can compress and decompress data efficiently. It consists of two main programs: one for compressing files and another for decompressing compressed files.

## Features

- Provides a file compression program that takes a file as input and compresses it using efficient compression algorithms.
- Offers a decompression program that takes a compressed file as input and translates it back to its original state.
- Utilizes various compression techniques to achieve optimal compression ratios.
- Supports different file formats for compression, including text files, images, and more.
- Provides options for customization, such as compression levels and output file formats.

## Getting Started

To get started with Antman, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/antman.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd antman

3. Compile the source code:

    make

4. Compress a file:

    ./antman_compress input.txt compressed.ant

5. Decompress the compressed file:

    ./antman_decompress compressed.ant output.txt

6. Verify that the output file matches the original file.
